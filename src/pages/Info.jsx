          This interactive tool was made to visualize variables relating to the
          Low-Income Housing Tax Credits program within the state of Delaware
          legislative districts. Made possible through the collaboration of Tech

              Legislative boundary redistricting occurs generally every 10 years. To account for this, there are two district boundary layers for each legislative house. For years before 2022, the 2011 district boundaries are used. For 2022 and the sum over all years, the current (2022) district boundaries are used. Current (2022) senator and representative names are used regardless of the year selected.
